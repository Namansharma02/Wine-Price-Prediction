# Wine-Price-Prediction Model built with Keras Functional Model API
This model takes a wine's description and varietyas input and predicts the price of the wine.

# Input 
* Description - The color is a bit murky, but the wine offers sound, solid varietal aromas and plenty of sweet fruit. It's definitely front-loaded, with sweet cherry/berry and a nicely managed finish with a lick of chocolate. It shows the California influence of the winemaker, who is based in Santa Rosa.
* Variety - Pinot Noir
# Prediction
* Price Predicted:  41.068443 
* Actual Price :  39.0

# Requirements
* Make sure you have TensorFlow, Pandas, and Jupyter installed
* Also this worked when I installed Tensorflow 1.07
* It gives zero accuracy on Tensorflow 1.12
